## M5Stack Performance
- Advantages of M5Stack platform are repeatability and solving power of ESP32. 

- In comparison with original project, performance level increases up to about 15 times, and is 2000-5000 nodes per second, which provides up to 10 plyes depth of solving tree in hard situations, and more in easy positions.

<br />  

## Controls
- Interface uses 3 buttons - left, choice, and right. 
- Left and right to choose move (highlighted with green frames), choice button to make move.
